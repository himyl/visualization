## Installation
To run the scripts in this project, ensure you have the required Python libraries installed. You can install them using the following command:
```
pip install pyecharts
```

## Usage
- 1. Running Individual Scripts: Each directory contains .py files for different chart types. You can run these scripts individually to generate the visualizations. For example:
```
python Bar/bar_base.py
```
This command will generate an HTML file, which can be opened in a browser to view the chart.
- 2. Running All Visualizations: To generate all visualizations at once, use the run_all.py script located in the main directory:
```
python run_all.py
```
This script will execute each visualization script, creating HTML files for all charts in the project.

## Requirements
* Project based on pyecharts 2.0.3
