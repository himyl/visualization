## Data Visualization Collection
This project contains a collection of Python scripts to generate various types of data visualizations. Each type of chart is organized into a separate folder, showcasing diverse methods and designs for representing data visually. 

## Installation
To run the scripts in this project, ensure you have the required Python libraries installed. You can install them using the following command:
```
pip install pyecharts
```

## Usage
- 1. **Running Individual Scripts**: Each directory contains .py files for different chart types. You can run these scripts individually to generate the visualizations. For example:
```
python Bar/bar_base.py
```
This command will generate an HTML file, which can be opened in a browser to view the chart.
- 2. **Running All Visualizations**: To generate all visualizations at once, use the run_all.py script located in the main directory:
```
python run_all.py
```
This script will execute each visualization script, creating HTML files for all charts in the project.

## Project Contents
Each chart type includes the following:
* Python Script (.py): Contains the code to generate the visualization.
* Markdown File (.md): Documentation about the specific visualization, explaining its purpose and usage.
* HTML Output (.html): The resulting chart, which can be viewed in a web browser.

## Requirements
* Project based on pyecharts 2.0.3
